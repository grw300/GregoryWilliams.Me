# Keeping my `emotions` in check

I'm not a web developer. Keeping CSS classes and JSX elements connected gives me anxiety, so I need something to help. Enter [emotion](https://emotion.sh).

## Styled components rock!

Being able to directly [style the components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) in JSX and re-use that styled component is a big win from emotion. As this site gets developed, the ability to keep styles maintainable by re-using those components should pay dividends. But we'll have to see. For now, I'm really enjoying the syntax.
